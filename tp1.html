<p style="padding:20px;font-size:30px;text-align:justify;color:black;font-style:Times New Roman"><i>Mumbai</i> consists of seven islands by the coast of Arabian Sea that are connected by bridges and land fill. It is the capital of the <i>Indian</i> state of <i>Maharashtra</i> and the business and financial capital of <i>India</i>. <i>Mumbai</i> transferred from Portuguese to British rule as part of Catherine of Braganza’s dowry to Charles II in 1661. It rose to become <i>India's</i> largest city, driven in large part by its status as a leading cotton trading market and shipping port.

    <i>Mumbai's</i> history offers many heritage structures and historical precincts. Most are located in the south of <i>Mumbai</i>, as historically, access to the city was only through the port there. The southern tip of the city is home to the Fort precinct, the urban core of <i>Mumbai</i> during the colonial period that was once enclosed by fortified walls. Mumbai had 591 heritage structures registered as of 2012. These include buildings, archaeological sites, colonial, industrial, domestic architectural sites and public spaces. A consulting committee called <b><i>"The Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee"</i></b> guides the process. All work related to heritage structures needs approval from this committee. Heritage structures are classified as Grade I, Grade IIA, Grade IIB or Grade III. Most of the structures were built in the British period. They are in the Victorian Neo Gothic architectural style, Indo-Saracenic Revival (Mulji Jetha Fountain) or Neoclassical styles. The <b>Elephanta Caves</b> and <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus </b>railway station are recognised as World Heritage Sites Mumbai is also home to a large number of Art Deco structures, with the largest count of buildings in this style after Miami. Many of these buildings are cinema halls, such as Eros Cinema and Regal Cinema. A string of Art Deco apartment buildings lines the city's waterfront promenade, <b>Marine Drive</b>. Conservationists and community groups attempted to have Mumbai's Art Deco buildings recognised as UNESCO world heritage status in 2013, but their attempts were unsuccessful.
