            The Global Vipassana Pagoda is a Meditation dome hall with a capacity to seat around 8,000 Vipassana meditators (the largest such meditation hall in the world) near Gorai, north-west of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The pagoda was inaugurated by Pratibha Patil, then President of India, on 8 February 2009.[1] It is built on donated land on a peninsula between Gorai creek and the Arabian Sea. The pagoda is to serve as a monument of peace and harmony. The Global Vipassana Pagoda has been built out of gratitude to Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899 - 1971), Vipassana teacher and the first Accountant-General of Independent Burma, who was instrumental in Vipassana returning to India, the country of its origin.[2][3]
        <p style="font-size:20px;padding: 5px;">
            Built entirely through voluntary donations, the purpose of the Global Vipassana Pagoda is to: 1) share information about Vipassana, and 2) spread information on Gotama the Buddha and his teachings. Vipassanā is the practical quintessence of the universal, non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha.[4]

Its traditional Burmese design is an expression of gratitude towards the country of Myanmar for preserving the practice of Vipassana. The shape of the pagoda is a copy of the Shwedagon Pagoda (Golden Pagoda) in Yangon, Myanmar. It was built combining ancient Indian and modern technology to enable it to last for a thousand years.[5][6]

The Global Vipassana Pagoda, Mumbai’s expression of gratitude to the Buddha, has carved a space for itself as one of the city’s prime architectural and cultural highlights within a relatively short period of time. Less than a decade old, the breathtakingly beautiful pagoda contains the world’s largest stone dome built without any supporting pillars. The dome is twice the size of the dome of the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, which was previously the largest hollow stone monument in the world.
Inaugurated in 2009 by Pratibha Patil, who was then prime minister of India, the Global Vipassana Pagoda took over eight years to build. While planning for its construction began in 1997, actual work on the primary structure started in 2000 and came to an end by 2008. However, the pagoda complex is still under construction to this day, with additional structures expected to be completed in the near future.

    Fashioned after the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar, the Global Vipassana Pagoda bears a spire covered in real gold and topped with a decorative umbrella piece donated by Myanmar. The wooden main doors to the structure were also hand-carved in Myanmar, while the main building material was sandstone brought from Rajasthan. The pagoda’s construction blends the best of ancient Indian and modern technology, preparing it to last a thousand years.
    The strikingly beautiful monument was built to honor Gautama Buddha and his wise lessons. The central hall, which accommodates about 8,000 students who can sit and meditate jointly, houses relics of the Buddha and aims to encourage the continuous learning of his teachings. While the pagoda seeks to be a symbol of re-awakening of the Buddha’s teachings in India, it is also an expression of thanks to Myanmar for preserving his life lessons.
