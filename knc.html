            The Kanheri Caves (Kānherī-guhā [kaːnʱeɾiː ɡuɦaː]) are a group of caves and rock-cut monuments cut into a massive basalt outcrop in the forests of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, on the former island of Salsette in the western outskirts of Mumbai, India. They contain Buddhist sculptures and relief carvings, paintings and inscriptions, dating from the 1st century CE[1] to the 10th century CE. Kanheri comes from the Sanskrit Krishnagiri, which means black mountain.[2]
The site is on a hillside, and is accessible via rock-cut steps. The cave complex comprises one hundred and nine caves. The oldest are relatively plain and unadorned, in contrast to later caves on the site, and the highly embellished Elephanta Caves of Mumbai. Each cave has a stone plinth that functioned as a bed. A congregation hall with huge stone pillars contains a stupa (a Buddhist shrine). Rock-cut channels above the caves fed rainwater into cisterns, which provided the complex with water.[3] Once the caves were converted to permanent monasteries, their walls were carved with intricate reliefs of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas. Kanheri caves were built in the 1st century and had become an important Buddhist settlement on the Konkan coast by the 3rd century CE.[4]

            Most of the caves were Buddhist viharas, meant for living, studying, and meditating. The larger caves, which functioned as chaityas, or halls for congregational worship, are lined with intricately carved Buddhist sculptures, reliefs, pillars and rock-cut stupas. Avalokiteshwara is the most distinctive figure. The large number of viharas demonstrates there was a well organized establishment of Buddhist monks. This establishment was also connected with many trade centers, such as the ports of Sopara, Kalyan, Nasik, Paithan and Ujjain. Kanheri was a University center by the time the area was under the rule of the Maurayan and Kushan empires.[2] In the late 10th century, the Buddhist teacher Atisha (980–1054) came to the Krishnagiri Vihara to study Buddhist meditation under Rahulagupta.[5]

    History of Kanheri Caves

    Deeply nestled among the tranquil surroundings of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Borivali in Mumbai, are more than 100 Buddhist caves popularly known as the Kanheri Caves. Kanheri, known as Krishnagiri or Kanhagiri in ancient inscription, literally means black mountain (Krishna means black and giri is mountain) and is mostly named after its black basaltic stone. Spanning from the 1st century BC to 11th century AD, an era that saw the rise and decline of Buddhism, these caves present an insight into its evolution and also have the distinction of having the largest number of cave excavations from a single hill.
    The earliest cave constructions coincide with the arrival of Buddhism in Anathara, Sopara. Most of these caves are simple single or multiple-cell viharas, or monasteries, devoid of any decorations and meant for simple living, studying and meditating. Chaityagraha serves the purpose of worship halls. Most of the decorative art can be seen in later excavations and, in some cases, as a later addition to the earlier caves. A colossal Buddha and Chaityagraha in Cave 3, a large Avalokiteshvara (Bodhisattva who represents compassion) in Cave 2, a painted ceiling in Cave 34 and an evolved water management system (indicated by the presence of water cisterns in almost every cave and huge water tanks) are a few of the highlights at the Kanheri Caves.

        Kanheri thrived for nearly a millennium owing to its proximity to the ancient port towns of Sopara (Nalasopara – known for its trading ties with Mesopotamia and Egypt, amongst others), Kalyan, Thane and Bassein (Vasai). Most of these caves have no date, but inscriptions with the mention of donors and specific king names have helped in their identification.
Entrance to the caves is five kilometers farther inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park’s entrance.There is the option of driving one’s vehicle, walking, taking a bus ride or cycling up to the caves. The caves are closed on Mondays.
